## Project Overview
## Part 1: Predicting species in test dataset from a given dataset
This part involves performing EDA and applying ML algo's in a given dataset containing features like **message**, **number of fingers**, **tail presence** and target variable **species** to predict **species** in the train dataset.

## Part 2: Predicting Troop Betrayal in the War Against the Phrygians
This project aims to predict which soldiers in your army are most likely to betray the clan using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques. Features such as **greed**, **temptation**, **loyalty**, **respect**, and **peer influence** are hypothesized to influence the likelihood of betrayal.
